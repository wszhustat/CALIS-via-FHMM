# CALIS-via-FHMM
CALIS-FHMM is a program to perform covariate-adjusted multiple testing via factorial hidden Markov models, which is written in R code. Here, CALIS-FHMM program contains four main files:       function 'rdata.fhmm' (rdata.fhmm.R) is the factorial HMM data generator.       function 'bwfw.fhmm' (bwfw.fhmm.R) realizes the forward-backward procedure.       function 'em.fhmm' (em.fhmm.R) realizes the E-M algorithm.       function 'mt.fhmm' (mt.fhmm.R) realizes the new multiple testing procedures.
